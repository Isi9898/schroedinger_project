# schroedinger_project


In this project, the solution for the one-dimensional time-independent Schroedinger equation can be calculated for any potential. Additionally, there is a visualizer which plots the potential, eigenvalues, wavefunctions, expectation values and the uncertainty for the position. Both are brought together in one file, which can be executed.

The documentation of this project and how to use it in detail can be seen within the sphinx-documentation.
